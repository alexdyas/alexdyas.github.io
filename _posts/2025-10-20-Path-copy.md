Two functions to be included in your `.zshrc` to copy the current path to the clipboard. These use `xlcip`, I'm sure there are alternatives or other tools for your setup.
pwcc - Copy current path to clipboard:
```
function pwdcc() {
    pwd | tr -d "\n" | xclip -selection clipboard
}
```
filecc - Copy the full path of <file> to the clipboard:
```
function filecc() {
    if [ -z $1 ] || [ ! -f $1 ]
    then
        echo Give me a file you dummy
        return 1
    fi
    readlink -f $1 | tr -d "\n" | xclip -selection clipboard
}
```
These should easily be convertable to other shells.
