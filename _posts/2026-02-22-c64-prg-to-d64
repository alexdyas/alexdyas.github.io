Adding a C64 `.prg` file to a C64 `.d64` disk image so it will be readable in an emulator:

- Get the Vice C64 emulator - https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io
- Unpack the archive
- Locate the `bin/c1541` executable, this is a C64 disk image maintenance utility
- Use the following command, adjusted for your own case:
```
./c1541 -format disk1,id d64 "somefilename.d64" -attach disk1.d64 -write somefilename.prg "Some File Name"
```
