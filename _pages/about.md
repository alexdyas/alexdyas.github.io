This blog is mainly technical posts about stuff I'm working or tinkering on, Kubernetes, amateur electronics, Python, Processing language, Linux etc.

Other than that, I'm British, I live in France, work in Switzerland. I like making stuff, woodworking, reading, playing guitar, snowboarding, cooking, music, films. I try to meditate when I can. I have a growing collection of board games (~50 at the time of writing).
